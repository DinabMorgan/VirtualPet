# Virtual Pets Re-Imagined
## Overview
Do you remember Cyberpet? Tamagotchi? Digimon? Petz? Virtual pets like these were born in 1996. With your help, they will be reborn. Virtual Toys, Inc. wants you to build the next iteration of virtual pets to market to adults who enjoy updated versions of the toys and games they played in their youth.  This game will be like the virtual pets of 1996...but so much more. It’s Virtual Pets Re-Imagined with your own personal touch!


HOW TO PLAY

Welcome to the wonderful, yet curious mind of a three year old name MAX. Max loves his friends, and believe me, he has a lot of them. However, the four that make up his entourage are Llama Llama AKA DADA Llama, Meow (Raccoon) AKA MAMA Meow, Sharkie AKA NOM NOM AKA BABY SHARK, and OPA! the Octopus. With this awesome game, you also get his new obssession - ROBOTS, though he is very sad they are not Robots in space, but don't worry kid, they might be the expasion pack! As well as puppies. Another exapasion pack.

Sooooo how do you play this awesome game?! Well, first you need to create a pet/friend. And, to make this game even more fun, you can create as many friends as you want! In fact, go wild! Then select a pet that you want to interact with, and then play a game, feed the pet, and even take it to the doctor. However, if you forget about a pet, it starts to get sad and lonely, and the pets health will start to go down. But take it to the doctor, and the health go up again, or feed the pet, or play with the pet and the pet will be happy again!

When you are done with playing with all of your pets, just exit the game.

Enjoy and as Max says "byyyyyyeeeeeee" (with frantic waving!)
